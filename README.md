# Application Task Hyper Island 2020

App that makes you do something to contribute to the UN sustainability goals

## The conditions of the application task

The conditions that were presented in the application task has been tormenting my mind for some time. In a good way of course. Therefore, I have compiled all of my conclusions below and how I ended up with the product that is downloadable for anyone. 

## 1. Cirkle of Influence:
   * You can determine your cirkle of influence through have's and be's. For example, "If I had a life partner", "I will be happy when I have ..." is your cirkle of concern. "I can be more patient", "I can be more inclusive" determines your cirkle of influence. It is the character focus. Contradictory to what I first believed that it was more of what you know or are capable of rather than the characteristics you can change to expand your cirkle of influence. 
   The question I then had to ask myself was; "how can I change my characteristics to help achieve one of the UNSG?"
   * Stephen R. Covey, author of the book _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ discusses the change paradigm from looking at a problem inside-out rather than outside-in. Anytime we think of a problem "out-there" we empower that problem to control us - What is out-there has to change before we do. According to Stephen R. Covey, "[Change has to come] inside-out; to be different, and by being different, to affect positive change on what is "out there"; I can be more resourceful, I can be more creative, I can be more cooperative". 
   * To change, Stephen R. Covey presents three kinds of control; Direct control, indirect control and no control. Direct controrl are problems that are solved by working on our habits, inderict control are problems that are solved by changing the method of our influence, such as reasoning and no control is accepting that we cannot do anything about the problems - So that they do not cotrol us.
