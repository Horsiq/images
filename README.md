# Application Task Hyper Island 2020

App that makes you do something to contribute to the UN sustainability goals

## The conditions of the application task

The conditions that were presented in the application task has been tormenting my mind for some time. In a good way of course. Therefore, I have compiled all of my conclusions below and how I ended up with the product that is downloadable for anyone. If the presentation elapses the five minute limit, please skip __1. Cirkle of Influence__ and __Factfulness _Ten Reasons Why We are Wrong about the World - And Why Things are Better than You Think_ by Hans Rosling__ and move onto __3. Conclusion__ and __4. Product Presentation__.

## 1. Cirkle of Influence:
   * You can determine your cirkle of influence through have's and be's. For example, "If I had a life partner", "I will be happy when I have ..." is your cirkle of concern. "I can be more patient", "I can be more inclusive" determines your cirkle of influence. It is the character focus. Contradictory to what I first believed that it was more of what you know or are capable of rather than the characteristics you can change to expand your cirkle of influence. 
   The question I then had to ask myself was; "how can I change my characteristics to help achieve one of the UNSG?"
   * Stephen R. Covey, author of the book _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ discusses the change paradigm from looking at a problem inside-out rather than outside-in. Anytime we think of a problem "out-there" we empower that problem to control us - What is out-there has to change before we do. According to Stephen R. Covey, "[Change has to come from] inside-out; to be different, and by being different, to affect positive change on what is "out there"; I can be more resourceful, I can be more creative, I can be more cooperative". 
   * To change, Stephen R. Covey presents three kinds of control; Direct control, indirect control and no control. Direct controrl are problems that are solved by working on our habits, inderict control are problems that are solved by changing the method of our influence, such as reasoning and no control is accepting that we cannot do anything about the problems - So that they do not control us. 
   * At the very heart of our cirkle of influence is our ability to make and keep promises. The commitments that we make to ourselves and others. It is here we find two ways to put ourselves in control of our lives, we can make a promise - And keep it. Or, we can set a goal and work to achieve it.
   
## 2. Factfulness _Ten Reasons Why We are Wrong about the World - And Why Things are Better than You Think_ by Hans Rosling:
* __The Gap Instinct__, the irresistable temptaion to divide all kinds of things into two groups. More than often, two conflicting groups; rich versus poor, west and the rest, developed and developing. According to Hans Rosling, there is no gap between developed and developing countries. 75% of the world population live in middle-income countries.
* __The Negativity Instinct__, the misconception that the world is getting worse. According to Rosling, people living under $2 dollars a day have halved since 1966 and life expectancy is today 72 years world wide. 
* __The Straight Line Instinct__, Hans Rosling presents an example of a graphical line with the world's population growth so far. People instictly expect the line to continue straight but it will actually flatten at around the year 2100. 
* __The Fear Instinct__, when we are afraid we do not see clearly. We have to recognize that frightening things gets our attention and to realize that these things does not necessarily have to be the most risky.
* __The Size Instinct__, paying to much attention to the indiviudal visible victim rahter than to the numbers can lead us to spend all our resources on a fraction of the problem. According to Rosling, ". . . the most compassionate thing to do to use your brain and work out how to do the most good with what you have". Rosling presents an example, "So, if you are investing money to improve health on level 1 and 2. you should put it into primary school, nurse education and vaccines". 
* __The Generalization Instinct__
