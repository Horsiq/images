## The Conditions of the Application Task

When the conditions were presented in the application task, I was at first a bit conflicted over the idea of applying with the given literatures theories. Therefore, I have compiled all of my conclusions below to give a more undemanding idea of how my application task resulted in the ACT application. If you are well fimiliar to the application task literatures, feel free to skip __1. Circle of Influence__ and __2. Factfulness _Ten Reasons Why We are Wrong about the World - And Why Things are Better than You Think_ by Hans Rosling__ and move onto [__3. Conclusions__](https://github.com/Horsiq/applicationtaskHI/blob/master/README.md#3-conclusions) and [__4. Product Presentation__.](https://github.com/Horsiq/applicationtaskHI/blob/master/README.md#4-product-presentation)

## 1. Circle of Influence:
   * You can determine your circle of influence through have's and be's. For example, "If I had a life partner", "I will be happy when I have ..." is your circle of concern. "I can be more patient", "I can be more inclusive" determines your circle of influence. It is the character focus. Contradictory to what I first believed that it was more of what you know or are capable of rather than the characteristics you can change to expand your circle of influence. 
   The question I then had to ask myself was; "how can I change my characteristics to help achieve one of the UNSG?"
   * Stephen R. Covey, author of the book _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ discusses the change paradigm from looking at a problem inside-out rather than outside-in. Anytime we think of a problem "out-there" we empower that problem to control us - What is out-there has to change before we do. According to Stephen R. Covey, "[Change has to come from] inside-out; to be different, and by being different, to affect positive change on what is "out there"; I can be more resourceful, I can be more creative, I can be more cooperative". 
   * To change, Stephen R. Covey presents three kinds of control; Direct control, indirect control and no control. Direct controrl are problems that are solved by working on our habits, inderict control are problems that are solved by changing the method of our influence, such as reasoning and no control is accepting that we cannot do anything about the problems - So that they do not control us. 
   * At the very heart of our circle of influence is our ability to make and keep promises. The commitments that we make to ourselves and others. It is here we find two ways to put ourselves in control of our lives, we can make a promise - And keep it. Or, we can set a goal and work to achieve it.
   
## 2. Factfulness _Ten Reasons Why We are Wrong about the World - And Why Things are Better than You Think_ by Hans Rosling:
* __The Gap Instinct__, the irresistable temptaion to divide all kinds of things into two groups. More than often, two conflicting groups; rich versus poor, west and the rest, developed and developing. According to Hans Rosling, there is no gap between developed and developing countries. 75% of the world population live in middle-income countries.
* __The Negativity Instinct__, the misconception that the world is getting worse. According to Rosling, people living under $2 dollars a day have halved since 1966 and life expectancy is today 72 years world wide. 
* __The Straight Line Instinct__, Hans Rosling presents an example of a graphical line with the world's population growth so far. People instinctively expect the line to continue straight but it will actually flatten at around the year 2100. 
* __The Fear Instinct__, when we are afraid we do not see clearly. We have to recognize that frightening things gets our attention and to realize that these things does not necessarily have to be the riskest.
* __The Size Instinct__, paying too much attention to the indiviudal visible victim rather than to the numbers can lead us to spend all our resources on a fraction of the problem. According to Rosling, ". . . the most compassionate thing to do to use your brain and work out how to do the most good with what you have". Rosling presents an example, "So, if you are investing money to improve health on level 1 and 2. you should put it into primary school, nurse education and vaccines". 
* __The Generalization Instinct__, we need generalizations and categorization to live our everyday life. But, we need also to realize when the generalizations and categories are misleading, such as developed- and developing countries. The best way to do this is to travel and have a firsthand experience. According to Rosling, "It is always good to question your categories". And, there are five ways to do so; look for differences and similarities across groups, beware of the majority, beware of the exceptional examples, assume you are not normal and beware of generalizing from one group to another.
* __The Destiny Instinct__, the idea that some things such as countries and societies are unable to change because they are destined not to. The truth is that cultures, nations, religions and people move, change and transform. Some faster than others. To control the Destiny Instinct you have to remember that slow change is still change. 
* __The Single Perspective Instinct__, always being in favor or against any particular idea makes you blind to information that does not fit your perspective. Constantly test your favorite ideas for weaknesses, be humble of the extent of your expertise and see people who contradict and disagree with you. 
* __The Blame Instinct__, It is easy for us to blame someone with bad intentions when something goes wrong. However, the Blame Instinct makes us exaggerate the importance of an individual or group. For example, in the circumstance of global CO2 emissions, it is easy for us to seek blame on others. We must look for the causes of a problem not the villains.
* __The Urgency Instinct__, now or never! You have to act now or lose your chance forever! However, it is almost never true or that urgent. The Urgency Instinct makes us want to take immediate action on a potential threat. In terms of complex and often more abstract problems, the urgency instinct makes us astray when it comes to understanding the world. It makes us feel unnecessary stress and increases the risk of bad decision making. 
* __The Five Global Risks That We Should Worry About__; global pandemic, financial collapse, world war, climate change and extreme poverty. 

## 3. Conclusions 

As the last bullet point from Hans Roslings _Factfulness_ says, “. . . Risks that we should worry about; global pandemic, financial collapse, world war and extreme poverty.” Among these risks, which one can I in regards of using my circle of influence affect the most? 

According to Hans Rosling, the biggest villain in terms of CO2 emissions are the richest group (Level 4) and that we cannot expect mid-income countries to stop their development so that we can continue to live invariably:

  > _. . . we in the West seem to shift responsibility away from ourselves and onto others. We can say that “they” cannot live like us. The right way to say is, “We cannot live like us”._
  
I have therefore decided to choose UNSDG number 13 Climate Action. 

The next step is to determine your circle of influence through the conclusions from __1. Circle of Influence__.  

What are your “be’s”? How do you tackle Climate Action “inside-out”? What kind of “control” do you have? And what commitments you make to yourself?

I have reached the conclusion that I need to change the method of my influence to tackle the problem "inside-out" by the following “be’s”:
* I can be more resourceful 
* I can be more climatically aware
* I can be more helpful
* I can be more educated about climate change
* I can be more adaptable

The United Nations (UN) have a campaign called [ActNow](https://www.un.org/en/actnow/) that is designed to call for individual action on climate change. By commiting myself to the ActNow initiative, I am aligned with the method of my influence and also helping _us_ achieve UNSDG 13. Climate Action.

To help myself and others implement ActNow into our everyday and to push ourselves to commit to this initiative, I have developed an application called ACTDAILY which encourage you to register your climate actions each day. 

## 4. Product Presentation

ACTDAILY is an open source Android app designed to help users keep track and score of their daily acts against climate change.

Follow the instructions below to build and run the project:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the appropriate JDK
3. [Install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).
4. Import the project. Open Android Studio, click `Open an existing Android
   Studio project` and select the project. Gradle will build the project.
5. Run the app. Click `Run > Run 'app'`. After the project builds you'll be
   prompted to build or launch an emulator.
   
Upon launch the user will be presented with their current score and completed ACTs. They can choose to register new ACTs by clicking the button “ACT”. Then, by clicking on one or multiple items in the register activity, they can register their ACTs and the scores will be updated. 

| Icon | Launcher | Start | Register |
|------|----------|-------|----------|
|<img id="icon" width="190" height="400" src="https://github.com/Horsiq/applicationtaskHI/blob/master/Screenshot_ACTDAILY_Icon.png"> | <img width="190" height="400" src="https://github.com/Horsiq/applicationtaskHI/blob/master/Screenshot_ACTDAILY_launcher.png"> | <img width="190" height="400" src="https://github.com/Horsiq/applicationtaskHI/blob/master/Screenshot_ACTDAILY_startactivity.jpg"> | <img width="190" height="400" src="https://github.com/Horsiq/applicationtaskHI/blob/master/Screenshot_ACTDAILY_registeractivity.jpg"> |

From the start activity, if the user presses the information button in the top right corner, they will be presented a list of all the ACTs that is registrable. By clicking on one of the items in the lists they get more comprehensive information regarding that ACT. For example, it can show information regarding the problems evolving that ACT, what you need to do to register that ACT and how many points you get. The points system is based on the level of impact the ACTs has on climate change. By clicking the button, the user will be directed to the register activity.

| Start | Info | Info Item | Register |
|------|----------|-------|----------|
|<img id="icon" width="190" height="400" src="https://github.com/Horsiq/applicationtaskHI/blob/master/Screenshot_ACTDAILY_startactivity.jpg"> | <img width="190" height="400" src="https://github.com/Horsiq/applicationtaskHI/blob/master/Screenshot_ACTDAILY_infoactivity.jpg"> | <img width="190" height="400" src="https://github.com/Horsiq/applicationtaskHI/blob/master/Screenshot_ACTDAILY_infoitemActivity.jpg"> | <img width="190" height="400" src="https://github.com/Horsiq/applicationtaskHI/blob/master/Screenshot_ACTDAILY_registeractivity.jpg"> |

A notification is set to be sent every 24th hour. In other words, the user will be notified each day to register their daily ACTs. 

| Notification | Notification |

### 4.1 Updates

To encourage more engagement, encouragement and competitiveness, updates of the app will include a top score table with your “friends”. Below are further updates that might be included in the new version of the app: 

- Publication on Google Play
- A chat forum 
- The ability to send challenges on daily ACTs to friends
- To share results on social media, email, SMS etc. 
- All revenue collected from advertisement will go to [__Sustainable Development Goals Fund__](https://www.sdgfund.org/)

In other words, the app will become more inclusive, social and widespread. Below is a screenshot of a mockup with the same startactivity but with a ranking table and two more buttons; “Invite a friend” and “Share”.
