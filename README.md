# Application Task Hyper Island 2020

App that makes you do something to contribute to the UN sustainability goals

## The Conditions of the Application Task

The conditions that were presented in the application task has been tormenting my mind for some time. In a good way of course. Therefore, I have compiled all of my conclusions below and how I ended up with the product that is downloadable for anyone. If the presentation elapses the five minute time limit, please skip __1. Circle of Influence__ and __2. Factfulness _Ten Reasons Why We are Wrong about the World - And Why Things are Better than You Think_ by Hans Rosling__ and move onto __3. Conclusion__ and __4. Product Presentation__.

## 1. Circle of Influence:
   * You can determine your circle of influence through have's and be's. For example, "If I had a life partner", "I will be happy when I have ..." is your circle of concern. "I can be more patient", "I can be more inclusive" determines your circle of influence. It is the character focus. Contradictory to what I first believed that it was more of what you know or are capable of rather than the characteristics you can change to expand your circle of influence. 
   The question I then had to ask myself was; "how can I change my characteristics to help achieve one of the UNSG?"
   * Stephen R. Covey, author of the book _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ discusses the change paradigm from looking at a problem inside-out rather than outside-in. Anytime we think of a problem "out-there" we empower that problem to control us - What is out-there has to change before we do. According to Stephen R. Covey, "[Change has to come from] inside-out; to be different, and by being different, to affect positive change on what is "out there"; I can be more resourceful, I can be more creative, I can be more cooperative". 
   * To change, Stephen R. Covey presents three kinds of control; Direct control, indirect control and no control. Direct controrl are problems that are solved by working on our habits, inderict control are problems that are solved by changing the method of our influence, such as reasoning and no control is accepting that we cannot do anything about the problems - So that they do not control us. 
   * At the very heart of our circle of influence is our ability to make and keep promises. The commitments that we make to ourselves and others. It is here we find two ways to put ourselves in control of our lives, we can make a promise - And keep it. Or, we can set a goal and work to achieve it.
   
## 2. Factfulness _Ten Reasons Why We are Wrong about the World - And Why Things are Better than You Think_ by Hans Rosling:
* __The Gap Instinct__, the irresistable temptaion to divide all kinds of things into two groups. More than often, two conflicting groups; rich versus poor, west and the rest, developed and developing. According to Hans Rosling, there is no gap between developed and developing countries. 75% of the world population live in middle-income countries.
* __The Negativity Instinct__, the misconception that the world is getting worse. According to Rosling, people living under $2 dollars a day have halved since 1966 and life expectancy is today 72 years world wide. 
* __The Straight Line Instinct__, Hans Rosling presents an example of a graphical line with the world's population growth so far. People instictly expect the line to continue straight but it will actually flatten at around the year 2100. 
* __The Fear Instinct__, when we are afraid we do not see clearly. We have to recognize that frightening things gets our attention and to realize that these things does not necessarily have to be the most risky.
* __The Size Instinct__, paying to much attention to the indiviudal visible victim rahter than to the numbers can lead us to spend all our resources on a fraction of the problem. According to Rosling, ". . . the most compassionate thing to do to use your brain and work out how to do the most good with what you have". Rosling presents an example, "So, if you are investing money to improve health on level 1 and 2. you should put it into primary school, nurse education and vaccines". 
* __The Generalization Instinct__, we need generalizations and categorazisation to live our everyday life. But, we need also to realize when the generalisations and categories are misleading, such as developed- and developing countries. The best way to do this i to travel and have a first hand experience. According to Rosling, "It is always good to question your categories". And, there are five ways to do so; loof for differences and similarities across groups, beware of the majority, beware of the exceptional examples, assume you are not normal and beware of generalizing from one group to another.
* __The Destiny Instinct__, the idea that some things such as countries and societies are unable to change because they are destined not to. The truth is that cultures, nations, religions and people move, change and transform. Some faster than others. To control the Destiny Instinct you have to remember that slow change is still change. 
* __The Single Perspective Instinct__, Being always in favor or against any particular idea makes you blind to information that does not fit you perspective. Constantly test your favorite ideas for weaknesses, be humble of the extent of your expertise and see people who contradict and disagree with you. 
* __The Blame Instinct__, It is easy for us to blame someone with bad intentions when something goes wrong. However, the Blame Instinct makes us exaggerate the importance of an individual or group. For example, in the circumstance of global CO2 emissions, it is easy for us to seek blame on others. We have to look for the causes of a problem not the villains.
* __The Urgency Instinct__, now or never! You have to act now or lose your chance forever! However, it is almost never true or that urgent. The Urgency Instinct makes us want to take immediate action on a potential threat. In terms of complex and often more abstract problems, the urgency instinct makes us astray when it comes to understanding the world. It makes us feel unnecerssary stress and increases the risk of bad decision making. 
* __The Five Global Risks That We Should Worry About__; global pandemic, financial collapse, world war, climate change and extreme poverty. 

## 3. Conclusions 

As the last bullet point from Hans Roslings _Factfulness_ says, “. . . Risks that we should worry about; global pandemic, financial collapse, world war and extreme poverty.” I believe that the risk that I could contribute to the most in regards of my circle of influence is climate change. 

I have therefore decided to choose UNSDG number 13 Climate Action. 
What are my “be’s”? How do I tackle this problem “inside-out”? What kind of “control” do I have? And what commitments can I make to myself?

I need to change the method of my influence to tackle the problem "inside-out" by the following “be’s”:
* I can be more resourceful 
* I can be more climatically aware
* I can be more helpful
* I can be more educated about climate change
* I can be more adaptable

According to Hans Rosling, the biggest villain in terms of CO2 emissions are the richest group (Level 4) and that we cannot expect mid-income countries to stop their development so that we can continue to live invariably:
  _In fact, do you know how much of all the fossil fuel burned each year is burned by the richest billion? More than half of it. Then the second richest billion burns half of what is left, and so on and so on, down to the poorest million, who are responsible for 1 percent._
  _. . . we in the West seem to shift responsibility away from ourselves and onto others. We can say that “they” cannot live like us. The right way to say is, “We cannot live like us”._
