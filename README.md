# Application Task Hyper Island 2020

App that makes you do something to contribute to the UN sustainability goals

## The conditions of the application task

The conditions that were presented in the application task has been tormenting my mind for some time. In a good way of course. Therefore, I have compiled all of my conclusions below and how I ended up with the product that is downloadable for anyone. 

## 1. Cirkle of Influence:
   * You can determine your cirkle of influence through have's and be's. For example, "If I had a life partner", "I will be happy when I have ..." determines your cirkle of concern. "I can be more patient", "I can be more inclusive" determines your cirkle of influence. It is the character focus. Contradictory to what I first believed that it was more of what you know or are capable of rather than the characteristics you can change to expand your cirkle of influence. 
   The question I then had to ask myself was; "how can I change my characteristics to help achieve one of the UNSG?"
